# ADVISORY CONTROL
In the actually the teacher from the university of Ibegué, when are in the teacher’s room they needs focus in they projects, but the logistic in the advisory is badly, the students knocking the door every moment looking for the teacher, but this, disconcentrate the teachers, so in this project we need how we can order the advisory, in a order where the teacher don’t need up every moment to see if  is he that must give advisory, with this solution both sides don’t need interact. To resolve the problematic, we design a circuit of the prototype, we use some diode led, a LCD, the PIC 16F15244 and some push buttons, the idea is,  when a student is looking for a teacher, everyone knows for what teacher is the student, so in front of the teacher’s room is the LCD with some buttons, the student will looking for the teacher, select who is looking for, in the other side there is a table with the LEDS, every LED represents a teacher, when a student goes for a advisory, they found the LCD and they search for the teacher when they found, select and the teacher see the table, he knows that is for he because his LED is in on, so he goes for his student.
